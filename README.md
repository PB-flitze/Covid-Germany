## learn how to use pandas in python for better understanding of Data Science

### Step 1. 
import, change and work with the data from the csv file using pandas basic built in functions.

### Step 2
visualization: implement a chart to see how the cases changed throughout the year. 
-> maybe a comparison to other countries. 

### Step 3
Analysis of Correlation: maybe there are some correlations beetween the dates and the cases. 
-> if necessary or if the knocwledge allows it, import some more csv files(like region spezific outbreaks and so on) and compare them.

### Step 4
built a model to predict future cases.
